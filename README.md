## What is this?

SKMono is a commandline utility for easily managing SvelteKit monorepos.

## Installation

*[View SKMono on npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sk-mono)*

You can install SKMono with your favorite Node package manager:

```sh
npm install --save-dev sk-mono
pnpm add --save-dev sk-mono
yarn add --dev sk-mono
```

## Usage

Once installed, SKMono can be run with the `sk-mono` command:

```sh
sk-mono --version
```

Hyphens are a pain though, so SKMono has two builtin aliases:

```sh
skmono --version
skm --version
```

## Contributing

Currently SKMono is not currently accepting code contributions.

If you have found a bug, have an idea for a feature, or think there's a better
way to do something, please open an issue.
